Hundstrid
============================

Hundstrid is a multiplayer WebGL game developed with the Goo Engine and inspired by the old Asteroids game. It includes support for PS3/4 controllers as well as mobile phones (via websockets). The game runs on a single screen and players can connect and play by scanning a QR code with their mobile device, which turns into a controller.
